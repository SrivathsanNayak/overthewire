# Krypton

## Level 0

* Goal - Welcome to Krypton! The first level is easy. The following string encodes the password using Base64: S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ=. Use this password to log in to krypton.labs.overthewire.org with username krypton1 using SSH on port 2231. You can find the files for other levels in /krypton/

* Solution -

```shell
base64 --help

echo S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ= > decode.txt

base64 -d decode.txt
#password (KRYPTONISGREAT)

ssh krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2231 -l krypton1
```

## Level 1

* Goal - The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!

* Solution -

```shell
ls -la
#no files

ls -la /krypton/
#contains files for levels

ls -la /krypton/krypton1/
#contains 2 files

cat /krypton/krypton1/README
#instructions

cat /krypton/krypton1/krypton2
#contains ROT13 encrypted text
#YRIRY GJB CNFFJBEQ EBGGRA

tr 'A-Z' 'N-ZA-M'
#enter encrypted text
#LEVEL TWO PASSWORD ROTTEN
#password (ROTTEN)

exit
```

## Level 2

* Goal - The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3. It is in 5 letter group ciphertext. It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher. Without any further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break. You do not have direct access to the key, however you do have access to a program that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the key. If you think logically, this is completely easy.

* Solution -

```shell
ssh krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2231 -l krypton2

ls -la /krypton/krypton2
#shows files

cat /krypton/krypton2/README

cat /krypton/krypton2/krypton3
#contains encrypted password OMQEMDUEQMEK

mktemp -d

cd /tmp/tmp.RWWXXJoIOv

ln -s /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat
#creates symbolic link, for encrypt to run

ls -la

chmod 777 .
#full permission

/krypton/krypton2/encrypt
#use to encrypt file containing plaintext

/krypton/krypton2/encrypt /etc/issue
#trial, as given in README
#creates ciphertext file

ls -la

cat ciphertext
#has plaintext converted to ciphertext

touch testfile

vim testfile
#we can add alphabets A-Z here to see how the encrypt function works

/krypton/krypton2/encrypt testfile

cat ciphertext
#contains text from M-Z and A-L
#we can use tr to decode ciphertext

tr 'M-ZA-L' 'A-Z' < /krypton/krypton2/krypton3
#password (CAESARISEASY)

exit
```

## Level 3

* Goal - The password to the next level is found in the file ‘krypton4’. You have also found 3 other files. (found1, found2, found3) You know the following important details: The message plaintexts are in English - They were produced from the same key.

* Solution -

```shell
ssh krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2231 -l krypton3

ls -la /krypton/krypton3
#shows multiple files

cat /krypton/krypton3/README

cat /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#contains encrypted password

cat /krypton/krypton3/HINT1
#some letters are more prevalent in English than others

cat /krypton/krypton3/HINT2
#frequency analysis is your friend

cat /krypton/krypton3/found1
#contains more encrypted text
#found2 and found3 also have encrypted text
#all of them from the same key

grep -o . /krypton/krypton3/found1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
#for letter frequency analysis
#grep -o for only matching input, sort and uniq combined for counting all characters
#sort -rn for sorting numerically in reverse
#this gives a letter count

grep -o . /krypton/krypton3/found2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

grep -o . /krypton/krypton3/found3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
#all three files gives S,Q,J,N,U,B,C as most common characters
#in English language we can check which characters are most common
#E,A,R,I,O,T,N are most common
#so we can use tr to attempt cracking of krypton4 cipher

tr 'S-ZA-R' 'E-ZA-D' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#did not work
#try replacing letter by letter now

tr '[S]' '[E]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#replaces S by E in cipher text
#by increasing one character at a time, we can try to crack cipher

tr '[JDS]' '[THE]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#JDS is a common string, so it can be THE in plaintext

tr '[JDSQ]' '[THEA]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4

tr '[JDSQN]' '[THEAO]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#we can notice some words, based on that trial and error can work

tr '[JDSQNVI]' '[THEAOLV]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4

tr '[JDSQNVIK]' '[THEAOLVW]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4

tr '[JDSQBVIKWG]' '[THEAOLVWDN]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#we can see that WELL DONE is the first part, so we can carry on

tr '[JDSQBVIKWGU]' '[THEAOLVWDNS]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#we can see the letters for the word PASSWORD, so we will guess more

tr '[JDSQBVIKWGUYN]' '[THEAOLVWDNSPR]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#the word before PASSWORD can be FOUR

tr '[JDSQBVIKWGUYNXMCA]' '[THEAOLVWDNSPRFUIB]' < /krypton/krypton3/krypton4
#WELL DONE THE LEVEL FOUR PASSWORD IS BRUTE
#we can confirm this by using same key for found files
#password (BRUTE)

exit
```

## Level 4

* Goal - This level is a Vigenère Cipher. You have intercepted two longer, english language messages. You also have a key piece of information. You know the key length! For this exercise, the key length is 6. The password to level five is in the usual place, encrypted with the 6 letter key.

* Solution -

```shell
ssh krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2231 -l krypton4

cd /krypton/krypton4

ls -la
#contains files, password in krypton5

cat found1

cat found2

cat HINT
#FA (Frequency Analysis) by keylength
#we have to analyze cipher texts at position 1,6,12,.. to reveal first letter, for example

mktemp -d

cd /tmp/tmp.7KeX4jePyK

vim trial.sh
: '
#!/bin/sh

cat < /krypton/krypton4/found1 | grep [A-Z] | sed 's: ::g' | sed -E 's/(.).{0,5}/\1/g' > found1_shift
grep -o . found1_shift | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

#stores all characters at every 6 indices in a file
#tail -c +1 for telling it to start from 1st character, as we will change it later
#for printing frequency of every character related to first letter of key
#so this is frequency analysis for first character of key
#we can do the same for different files and different indices
'

chmod 777 trial.sh
#keep editing the script, running it for different files and noting down the outputs in a file
#we know E,A,R,I,O,T,N are most common English characters
#so we can apply the same logic here and use trial-and-error
#we can also use [A-Z] mapped to [0-25] as a range to refer

#so, if J is most common in found1, that means it is mapped to E
#so first letter of key could be 9 - 4 = 5, that is, F

#similarly, we have to find all characters of the keytext

#modified script for other indices
: '
#!/bin/sh

cat < /krypton/krypton4/found1 | grep [A-Z] | sed 's: ::g' | tail -c +2  | sed -E 's/(.).{1,5}/\1/g' > found1_shift1
grep -o . found1_shift1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

#tail -c +2 used for reading from second character onwards
'

#for characters 1,7,13,.. most common is V(21)
#so second possible character for keytext is 21 - 4 = 17
#for characters 2,8,14,.. most common is I(8)
#so third character is 8 - 4 = 4
#possible keytext - FREKEY

cat /krypton/krypton4/krypton5
#HCIKV RJOX
#now we need to use this keytext to decode the password (plaintext)
#using the logic of Plaintext + Keytext = Ciphertext

#password (CLEARTEXT)
```
